## Overview
The main goal of this project was to generate kinodynamic trajectories using an RRT to release a ball so it would land at a desired location. This was a semester-long project at Northwestern University. The task is split into 5 main components: 

<l>
<li>  Sample a release state position, velocity, and angle that will land the ball at a desired position using projectile motion equations </li>
<li> Check the release state for validity using inverse kinematics and velocity bounds </li>
<li> Generate a kinodynamic RRT to plan a path from a given start state to the sampled release state </li>
<li> Check the RRT path for self collisions </li>
<li> Smooth the path and generate time-optimal, minimum-acceleration trajectories for each joint to follow </li>
</l>

All of the code for this project is hosted on [this page](https://github.com/rikkimelissa/baxter_throw).

#### Release state sampling 
This task samples object release points and velocities at random that will send the ball on a ballistic trajectory to the target point. This release state is tested for solvablity using inverse kinematics and tested for velocity bounds. 

An example is shown below of 30 sampled release points and their trajectories; the chosen release point is highlighted in red.

#### Kinodynamic RRT  <a name="Movement"></a>
This task finds a path from a given start position and velocity to the sampled position and velocity for each of Baxter's seven joints while obeying physically-based dynamic models and avoiding position and velocity limits. This approach is tailored to trajectory planning in high-dimensional state spaces and is therefore a good approach for the 14-DOF system. It utilizes a bidirectional RRT to speed up the sampling process.

An example is shown below for a 2-DOF system using a bidirectional kinodynamic RRT and the resulting path.

</p>

When extended to 14-DOF, the RRT results in paths like the one below which shows positions for each of the 7 joints over time.

#### Lazy collision checking  <a name="fine"></a>
Once a path has been found that connects the start and release states with a dynamically feasible trajectory, collisions are checked for each point along the path. The planner is lazy in that the path is found prior to collision checking as collision checking tends to be the most computationally intensive constraint to check. Collision checking uses the built in service from MoveIt!.

#### Path smoothing <a name="drop"></a>
This tasks employs a shortcutting method to smooth jerky trajectories for high DOF manipulators subject to collision constraints, velocity bounds, and acceleration bounds. This algorithm first converts the path to a trajectory over time using a 5th order spline that respects state conditions and velocity and acceleration limits. The shortcutting algorithm is then employed over 30 iterations: for each iteration, two random states are picked from the trajectory. The minimum execution time is determined by the slowest single-joint trajectory using the fastest dynamically feasible trajectory between joint states. Once this time has been determined, the rest of the joints are interpolated for this time using the minimum-acceleration interpolant. This new segment replaces the old segment only if the overall time for execution has been reduced.

Below is an example of the shortcutting method over 30 iterations. It smooths the path and reduces the overall time.

#### Performance

From the nominal starting position, the throwing accuracy is about 8 out of 10. From a flexible starting position, the accuracy is much worse. The inconsistency is a problem beyond the scope of this project, as there is no clear relationship between the path and the time of the release, and this is the largest perceived source of error. An effort is being made to use machine learning algorithms to figure out which starting conditions and path correspond to the highest accuracy.

#### Important nodes <a name="nodes"></a>
* `check_rrt_joint.py` iterates through RRT and path smoothing and sends results to the collision checker
* `check_state_for_collisions.py` sends joint lists to the collision service provided by MoveIt! and returns state validity
* `path_smooth.py` converts a path into a timed trajectory and smooths the path with shortcuts
* `release_state_sample` samples release states for projectile motion
* `release_state_solve` checks release states using IK and velocity bounds
* `rrt_joint.py` uses a kinodynamic RRT to calculate a path from start position to release position
* `throw_path.py` sends a path to the joint trajectory action server for execution

#### Dependencies <a name="Requirements"></a>

  *  Baxter SDK - follow the [Workstation Setup](http://sdk.rethinkrobotics.com/wiki/Workstation_Setup) Instructions
  * pykdl_utils package - clone [this](https://github.com/gt-ros-pkg/hrl-kdl.git ) repository
  * urdf package with apt-get install ros-version-urdfdom-py
  * kdl package with apt-get install ros-version-kdl-conversions

#### Instructions for running files  <a name="Instructions"></a>

To run the files, the workspace must be connected to Baxter and properly sourced. Then use the following command: `roslaunch baxter_throw throw_demo.launch`. In the input_state window, enter 1, 2, or 3 to move the box to one of three set positions which Baxter will throw to.
