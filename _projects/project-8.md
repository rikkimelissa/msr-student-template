## Overview
This project was part of the course MEAM 333, Machine Dynamics, at Northwestern University. The goal of this project was to dynamically model a gymnast performing a back handspring. The gymnast is modeled with six degrees of freedom and rotational inertia. Impacts occur as each joint hit its joint limits and when the hands hit the floor.
