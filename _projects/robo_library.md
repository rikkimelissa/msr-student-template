## Overview
This project was part of the course MEAM 449, Robotic Manipulation, at Northwestern University. The goal of the project was to develop a robotics software library. Functions include forward and inverse kinematics, motion trajectories in joint, screw axis, and cartesian space, cubic and quintic time scaling for motions that begin and end at zero velocity, and forward and inverse dynamics.

These functions were tested on a simulated version of the Universal Robots UR5 six-joint robot arm using ROS. Trajectories were generated using forward dynamics with torque input and joint and cartesian trajectories with quintic time scaling.

The library is hosted on [this page](https://github.com/rikkimelissa/robotics_library).
